<!-- This is the context xml for deployments of Annotation Engine in Tomcat.
     I (jatr) have made changes to it so as to tune the database connection pool for optimum
     performance and exception logging.  In the long term we should stop using this config for
     our data sources, we should configure them via Spring or Hibernate.
